I started this function with three arrays of the same length. One array stands for character types and another for integer types, and the last array for determining whether a new input is a character type (c), or an integer type (i). All of the arrays have a determined size, but if that size runs out, they get doubled in length. I have two arrays named "array_start" and "array_end" to keep track of stashes within the primary stash.
